## haskell ##
 
i found haskell to be a very instereting language to learn. I have spent quite some time programming in javascript. I found the funcitonal programming aspect of it very compelling. after I learned a little about lisp, i was total in love with funcitonal programming language. that's why i wanna learn haskell. it's modern, mature, and elegent. and sometimes it feels like a math.. oh math, love it too.

## what's this repo for? ##

just some random piece of code for exploring and practicing concepts of haskell. maybe others wanna look at it and learn something.
